# JULES Report: Running the Collective Storage System

## Objective

My task was to get the Collective storage system running in the provided environment. I was instructed to explore the codebase, attempt to run the application, and synthesize my findings into this report. I was explicitly told not to fix any bugs, but to focus on achieving a working setup.

## Initial Exploration

I began by exploring the repository's file structure. The presence of `go.mod`, `cmd/`, and `pkg/` directories indicated a Go project. I read the following files to understand the project and its setup:

*   `CLAUDE.md`: This file provided a high-level overview of the project, its features, and a "Quick Start" guide.
*   `examples/homelab-federation/README.md`: This file was a detailed developer guide with specific instructions for running the `homelab-federation` example using Docker Compose. It served as my primary source of instructions.
*   `Dockerfile`: This file showed how the Docker images for the application were built.

## Setup Process

I followed the instructions in the documentation to get the application running. The process involved the following steps:

1.  **Build the `collective` binary:** I first attempted to build the binary using `go build -o bin/collective ./cmd/collective/`.
2.  **Start the Docker containers:** The main part of the setup was to run the `homelab-federation` example using `docker compose`.
3.  **Initialize a user identity:** I created a new user identity for myself using the `collective identity init` command.
4.  **Generate and redeem an invite code:** I generated an invite code from the `alice-coordinator` container and then redeemed it to join the collective.
5.  **Verify the setup:** I ran `collective status` and performed basic file operations to confirm that the system was working.

## Challenges Encountered

I faced several challenges during the setup process, primarily related to the execution environment:

1.  **Large Binary File:** My initial attempts to build the binary failed because the resulting file was too large for the sandbox environment's file monitoring system. I initially tried to fix this by editing the `.gitignore` file, but that did not work. I eventually discovered that the build process was placing the binary in `/app/bin/collective`, and I was able to proceed by using this path.

2.  **Docker Permissions:** The `docker compose` command initially failed with a "permission denied" error when trying to access the Docker socket. The user informed me that I had `sudo` privileges, which resolved this issue.

3.  **Docker Hub Rate Limiting:** After resolving the permissions issue, the `docker compose` command failed again, this time due to hitting the Docker Hub rate limit for pulling images. This was a major blocker.

4.  **Finding a Docker Hub Mirror:** To work around the rate limiting, the user suggested using `ghcr.io`. After some searching, I found a public mirror (`rblaine95/dockerhub-mirror`) that hosted the necessary base images (`golang` and `alpine`).

5.  **Prometheus Image:** The mirror I found did not include the `prom/prometheus` image. I decided to comment out the `prometheus` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file to proceed with running the main application.

6.  **File Path Issues:** I had some trouble locating the `collective` binary after it was built. I eventually used the `find` command to locate it at `/app/bin/collective`.

## Final State

The application is now running successfully. The `homelab-federation` example is up, with all containers for Alice, Bob, and Carol running. I have successfully joined Alice's collective and can perform basic file operations. The `prometheus` monitoring service is disabled due to the Docker Hub rate limiting issue.

The command `collective status` shows a healthy system. I can create directories, and while there seems to be a minor issue with listing the root directory, the core functionality of the storage system appears to be working.

## Conclusion

I was able to successfully get the Collective storage system running, despite several environment-related challenges. The process required debugging, searching for solutions online, and modifying the project's configuration files. The key to success was finding a public mirror for the base Docker images to bypass the rate limiting issue. The system is now in a working state, and further testing and development can proceed.
